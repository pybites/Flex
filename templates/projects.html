    <h1>PyBites 100 Days {{ _('Projects') }}</h1>
  </header>

  <p>Here at PyBites we like to stretch ourselves. This means that we dedicate time not only to Articles, Challenges and News but also to additional projects. Below is a chronicling of the various projects we've completed and are currently working on.</p>

	<h3 class='projectHeader'>1. #100DaysOfCode (Mar 30, 2017 - Jul 07, 2017)</h3>
	<p><img src='https://pybit.es/images/100d_histogram.png' alt='we wrote 5K LOC histogram'></p>

	<p>We did it! #100DaysOfCode is done: 5K lines of code, 100 scripts, 100 modules. Just on the day PyBites turned 200 days.</p>

	<p>We highly recommend doing 100 Days no matter your level. Being aspiring or experienced programmers, you need deliberate practice. A lot of it. We can now assure you that 100Days makes you practice. And with the public commitment it's also a way to enhance your portfolio.</p>

	<h3 class='projectHeader'>2. Django (Jul 08, 2017 - Oct 16, 2017)</h3>
	<p>Yes, the rumors were true: our current 100 days project is around learning Django.</p>

	<p><img src='{{ SITEURL }}/{{ THEME_STATIC_DIR }}/img/django-logo.png' alt='Django logo'></p>

	<p>We will work incrementally on 3 or more projects which we will announce as we go. We will also tailor some articles and code challenges around this effort, so you can learn with us.</p>
	<p>This will be a lot of fun and with the first 100 Days project under our belt, we're sure that we will learn a thing or two about Django, which we hope you can benefit from too.</p>
