  <p>Every month we release 3-4 new Python code challenges here and review the solutions for the ones of last month. To be featured in our review PR (Pull Request) your work against <a href='https://github.com/pybites/challenges' target='_blank'>our repo</a> and make sure you answer the questions in our PR template. </p>
  
  <p>PyBites is all about learning Python through practical exercises and we love it. You can see open PRs <a href='https://pybites-prs.herokuapp.com' target='_blank'>here</a> (built for one of our challenges) and our review posts are below.</p>

  <p>To get started just <a href='https://github.com/pybites/challenges' target='_blank'>fork our challenges repo</a> and work on your solution locally. See <a href='https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md' target='_blank'>here</a> for more details how you can submit your solution. </p>

  <p>Remember, we don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition. The objective is to learn more and better Python. We believe solving code challenges is a very effective way to achieve this. Have fun!</p>
